<p>If I was teaching CS347 next semester, I would probably keep it a little bit of a flipped classroom. I would have students do the readings outside of class and when they come in, do a brief overview of what was learned, then get started on an in-class assignment to make sure they understand what they are doing. </p>
<p>I loved the textbook for this class and thought all the step by step stuff was very helpful. I think more focus with React would help the students, especially come time for project 3. </p>
