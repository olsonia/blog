        <p>This week we learned about flexboxes. Flexboxes are something that I am honestly not very good at. BUT I did find that MDN had a very helpful page on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox">Basic concepts of flexbox</a>. I referred to that page quite freqently when working on the tasks for Tuesday's lab. Task two was the one that my partner and I got stuck on. We found it difficult to get the images in that stairstep pattern. But it's okay because we tried our best. </p> 
        
        <p>On Thursday, we still worked with flexboxes. For one of our tasks, we had to create a photo masonry with a sticky sidebar. It was really fun to do. The sticky sidebar was something I was familiar with but the photo masonry was not. We also got to insert emojis into the sidebar! I've never put emojis in a webpage before so that was really cool! I didn't know how I was supposed to insert them but this code snippet from w3schools was very useful in figuring out how to do so:
            <img style="height:200px; width:500px" src="exampleB3.png">
        </p>
