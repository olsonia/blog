    <p>This week we started by doing an in class lab where we got to use CSS and html to create our webpages. My partner and I only got to the second task but it was still fun to do. I had to remember and look up a lot of the CSS because it has been quite a while since I have used it. The hardest part of the first task was trying to match the font of the body of the paragraph. In the second task, which was making a chessboard, I learned other ways you are able to use tables. It was really neat being able to see tables used in way that I've never seen before.</p>

    <p>In class we learned how to make cards and how to make letters with blocks. It was a lot of fun but also really hard because I forgot how margins worked for a hot second. But with the help of W3 Schools page on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp">CSS Margins</a>, I was able to remember how to use them. We intended to make the word "HIT" but ended up making the word "HOT" instead. I have learned a lot of CSS and had a good review of the CSS I learned last year! I am having a lot of fun (: The code below is what I used to help make my cards for task 1, which I found VERY useful!</p>
