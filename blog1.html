    <p>This week I learned how to set up a DigitalOcean account and get free credit from the Github Student Developer Pack, which I thought was kind of neat. Other than learning some more configuration stuff to get everything set up, this week felt like more of a review of all the HTML stuff I learned in the frontend web dev class. I reviewed simple HTML things like how to make unordered and ordered lists, heading sizes, inserting images, links, and linking to elements on the same page. Something new I learned from this week was how to use definition lists. That was not something I was very familiar with, so it was fun learning what tags to use and how to use them.</p>

    <p>Lab 3 gave me a nice review on forms and labels because it has been a while since I have used them. One website that I found really helpful when doing the forms task was the W3 schools page about <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp">HTML Forms</a>. Tables were another thing that was a good review for me because I have not made a table in HTML in close to a year. By using MDN Web Docs page on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table">the Table element</a> I was able to find some good code examples on what it should look like.</p>

    <p>This is a snippet of the sample code from the MDN Web Docs about tables that I found really useful when completing that task:</p>
